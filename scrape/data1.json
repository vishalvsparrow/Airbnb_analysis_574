         "comments":"We stayed at Julie's place for an extended period while our house in another Boston neighborhood was being renovated. Julie was very responsive and answered all our questions throughout our stay. Upon arriving Julie had a gift basket with wine and goodies which was a nice touch. The condo was extremely clean with all necessary accessories well stocked. The washer and dryer in the basement was very convenient. Although we did not have cable, we streamed our programs using the powerful wifi connection. I would recommend Julie's place not only due to the fact it was cozy and convenient but also because Julie did everything in her power to make our stay comfortable. ",

         "comments":"Positives: \r\n\r\n- Julie's \"Treetop Haven\" has views of leaves and trees from every window. It's walking distance to the green sanctuaries of Arnold Arboretum and Jamaica Pond as well as restaurants and stores in Jamaica Plane. \r\n\r\n- The apartment is very clean\r\n\r\n- Good Wifi\r\n\r\n- Kitchen is well equipped \r\n\r\n- Bedroom has ample storage space\r\n\r\n- Shower has good pressure and hot water\r\n\r\nNegatives\r\n\r\n- The TV only has antenna reception which drops out occasionally. The remote was broken and we got up to change the stations manually. I believe Julie will be upgrading the system, you should check it has if TV is important for you. \r\n\r\n- The bathroom hot water faucet was broken with a pre-existing issue and we had to wait 15 days or half of our stay for it to get repaired and in the meantime we used a screwdriver to turn the faucet. \r\n\r\n- The bathtub/shower is a pretty claw-foot tub with wrap-around curtain. It is very high off the ground, one needs to climb over and in.  It may be difficult for an elderly person. \r\n\r\n- The study room off the living room is being used for storage with boxes and bags covering the floor and no door to close it off from the living room. I have suggested it would have been nice to have it either cleared or closed off. \r\n\r\n- The sofa is not a sofa-bed. I chose to use it over the other option of an inflatable mattresses because I find inflatable mattresses uncomfortable and it would have taken up living room space. The sofa is very soft and I was not that comfortable on it for a month. \r\n\r\nLastly...\r\n\r\nJulie is a cool and interesting woman, I had a long conversation with her upon move-in and she was great with communication during our stay. I can tell by nature she is a nurturing and caring person and it reflected as a host. However, because of the above maintenance issues I have to say I was less than satisfied with my particular stay - what I got for the price I paid - but I am sure things will be improved for future guests. \r\n\r\n",

Julie welcomes you with a basket of goodies  and answers any questions you may have.\r\n\r\nThe apartment is clean and comfortable.   The bed and pillows are very comfortable.  You are in the center of Jamaica Plain and about a 15 minute walk to the Green Street or Forest Hills T stations.  The laundry in the basement and was an added bonus. \r\n\r\n You are sure to have a restful stay while you are in Julie's home. ",

         "comments":"We stayed at Julie's place for a month, and couldn't have been more content with our experience with her, her place, and her location.\nWe were traveling with a baby and she helped us by making sure the baby had a crib to sleep in and a booster seat for eating. \nThe house was perfectly comfortable and the neighbors were always incredibly friendly.\nAlso, if you are into cooking, this place had absolutely everything one might ever need for cooking. Seriously, one of the most complete kitchens I have ever seen! \nWhen we got there she had her signature flowers and a basketful of treats for us and the baby (even bubbles for him to play with!), and was incredibly supportive throughout our stay. At one point the microwave there died, and she helped us get a new one in no time. \nOverall we fell in love with her place and came to have it feel very much like home. When we visit Boston again we hope to go back to her haven!\nAlso, my son took his first steps in her apartment! We will love it forever because of this :).\n",

         "comments":"Our first Airbnb experience at Julie’s home was perfect! My wife and I have lived in Jamaica Plain for many years and we recently needed a short term housing solution while renovation work took place in our home. We wanted a quiet, private place right near the center of JP. Julie’s home was perfect and the process was seamless from start to finish. Julie is a terrific host, very kind and responsive. We arrived to a beautiful and extremely clean apartment, and she’d left behind a gift basket with flowers, chocolate and other goodies. We felt comfortable and at home during our twelve night stay, which we extended part way through. The home is on a very nice, quiet street close to restaurants, shops, the Arnold Arboretum and public transportation. Access to laundry and off street parking was a huge bonus. As other reviews have mentioned, it is very quiet, which was great. We were kind of dreading living in a temporary situation for two full weeks, but I don’t think it could have been any better. I would give Julie and her home the highest recommendation and will tell out-of- town visitors about it moving forward.  ",

Julie made herself accessible at all times to meet any needs and answer any questions. She made a point of making sure that I was comfortable and had everything that I needed. Her home is beautiful, bright, spotless and uncluttered. Each unit in the building has its own set of clothes washers and dryers located in the basement which was wonderful since I was there for 10 nights with a limited wardrobe. The kitchen is fully equipped and really well organized. Her home provided me a wonderful sanctuary to return to at the end of each day. Each morning I woke to the sounds of birds singing and a sense of tranquility. The location is very accessible. Shopping and restaurants are within a couple of blocks. The arboretum and Jamaica Pond are also just blocks away. I had a car which I parked in Julie's driveway, off street parking is a very nice perk. That said I could get just about everywhere I wanted to go without having to drive. It was a truly lovely find! ",

Julie was a fantastic host and was very thoughtful and accommodating with our needs. We loved the thoughtful touches like the flowers and the welcome basket. The small TV room was big enough to use as a second bedroom for our 1-year old's travel crib, so there was more than enough space. We thoroughly enjoyed or stay and would highly recommend this place to others! ",

We feel so lucky to have stayed in Julie's Treetop Haven, which lives up to its name with the nature we experienced right outside the windows!\r\n\r\nJulie was so kind and very easy to communicate with.  She quickly responded to all my messages and even checked to make sure all was well during our stay.  Julie went above and beyond to make our stay magical.  We were in town for our sister-in-law's wedding and we were also celebrating our 14th anniversary.  Julie left us a gorgeous handmade flower arrangement, a sweet card, delicious chocolates, wine, and little snacks.  She also gave us amazing coffee from her Keurig and even asked what kind of creamer I like, leaving organic nondairy creamer to accommodate my lactose intolerance.  So amazingly kind!  \r\n\r\nAs far a location is concerned, Julie's home is in a super safe neighborhood where we felt comfortable walking around at night.  It's a 5 minute walk to a gorgeous arboretum, a 10 minute walk to the  Green St. T station (it's about a 20 minute ride into downtown Boston), and a 10 minute walk to all the downtown JP goodness.  We loved spending time in JP with all the great places to eat.  Our favorites were Fiore's for breakfast, City Feed and Supply for groceries and lunch, and JP Licks for dessert.  Everything you need is walking distance in town, from a dry cleaners to drug store to a grocery store.  There is a great farmer's market on Thursday afternoon.  The JP Pond is also worth a visit.  I would love to live in JP! \r\n\r\nJulie's home is clean and comfortable, with beautiful artifacts from all her world travels.  I loved coming \"home\" from our daily adventures.  The air conditioning works very well, the claw foot bathtub is to die for, and the bed is extremely comfortable!  We appreciated the awesome closet unit in the bedroom, with tons of drawer space and room to hang our nice clothes.  Julie's relaxation room is heaven and there is so much beautiful natural light in every room.  You will love the tree in the front yard.  In the mornings, I took my coffee to the living room windows and just watched all the squirrels and birds frolic and eat.  Being on the second floor was perfect for observing the nature.   \r\n\r\nWhen I'm back in Boston, I will definitely stay at Julie's Treetop Haven!  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
